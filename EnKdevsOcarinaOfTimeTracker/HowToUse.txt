Thanks for downloading my Ocarina of Time Item Tracker!
Before you start using this software, I just want to point out a few things before you should use this:

It should be noted that this software is meant to be used as you're playing through
an Ocarina of Time Randomizer run, whether be it one generated through the usual web generator
or through Ship of Harkinian.

To activate an item on the tracker, simply left click on it.
To deactivate an item on the tracker, you have to right click it.
The spiritual stones and medallions have a third interaction that's special to those.
If you click with your middle mouse button on them, you can set their location reflecting on in which
dungeon these dungeon rewards are.

Please note:
Due to certain limitations posed by the UI technology used, some things can be coming off as slowly
or a bit janky.
There is sadly not much I can do to fix that behavior.
All I can advice you to do is to click slowly and not fast.

Secondly, if you are done with making progress for your current run, I implore you to press the Save button!
It will save your trackers state so you can just load it back in the next time you continue your randomizer run.

Thirdly, please use the Delete button as sparingly as possible.
It should only be used if your trackers state has somehow become corrupted and can't be read.
If that happens and you closed the tracker before that came to be, then sorry mate, tough luck.
(It is also advised to have a screenshot at the ready as a plan b to restore the previous tracker state if you made one)

And that's it, that should be all the instructions I can give to you for using this tracker.
If you have any suggestions for improvements, please leave an Issue over at the trackers github page.
You can find it here: https://github.com/EnKdev/EnKdevs-Item-Trackers

With that done, I hope this tracker will come handy to you.
